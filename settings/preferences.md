!!!light
This preference is applicable only for the web app. It has no effect on the mobile app.
!!!

When this setting is turned on, pressing the Enter key while typing a message in the inbox will send it instead of inserting a line break. You can always use *Ctrl + Enter* to send the message.

### Auto archive default

Set a default value for the auto-archive setting. When enabled, customer messages are archived as soon as a reply is sent. You can also toggle auto-archive for a specific conversation at the time of replying.

### Move archived conversation to the inbox on reply

When this setting is turned on, replying to an archived conversation will automatically move it back to the inbox.

### Auto enable chat translation on bulk messaging & outbound compose

When this setting is turned on, chat translation is enabled by default on the Bulk Messaging and Outbound Compose pages. You can turn it off while sending the message(s).

### Profile bar default tab

The profile bar appears on the rightmost side of the screen when viewing a conversation (e.g., sender's profile, notes, and follow-ups). You can choose which tab opens by default for your team.

#### Available options

1. Profile tab
2. Notes tab
3. Follow-ups tab

### Follow-ups tab preferences

These are additional preferences for the *Follow-ups* tab.

#### Open new follow-up form automatically when the follow-ups tab is opened

When this setting is turned on, a new follow-up reminder form opens by default instead of displaying existing follow-ups. This makes it easy for your team to add reminders quickly.

Since a reminder already appears in the inbox on the due date, and there's a separate page for viewing all the follow-ups, **keeping this setting on is recommended**.

#### Default tags for the new follow-up form

If there are tags you frequently use for new follow-up reminders (e.g., leads), adding them here will automatically prefill them whenever a new follow-up reminder form opens.
